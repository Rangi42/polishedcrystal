    This is the current Polished Crystal 3.0.0 *beta* release. The assets all have an 8-character "commit hash" at the end to identify the exact code they're built from.

    The **.gbc** assets are ROMs. If you just want to play the game, download one (regular or `-faithful`) and load it in [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/), [mGBA](https://mgba.io/), [Gambatte](https://github.com/sinamas/gambatte), or another accurate Game Boy Color emulator. (***Do not use VBA*** or VBA-M.) If your emulator or flashcart has issues with supporting a real time clock (or you desire it disabled for any other reason), download your preferred version with the `-nortc` flag.

    The **.sym** assets are "symbol files". They're useful for debugging, or for [discovering cheat codes](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Discovering-GameShark-cheat-codes), although cheats are *not* officially supported and may cause bugs or crashes. (Do ***not*** ask the developers for cheat codes.)

    The **.bsp** asset is a [BSP](https://github.com/aaaaaa123456789/bsp) save file patch in case you need to upgrade a save file from an older 3.0.0 beta build, using a patcher like the one for [Pokémon Prism](http://pokemonprism.com/patcher.html).

    The **polisheddebug** assets are ROMs and symbol files with extra features to help debug the game. Do ***not*** download these to just play with; use them to help the developers diagnose and fix bugs, or create new features.
