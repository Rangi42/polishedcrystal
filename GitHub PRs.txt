How to solve personal PRs on GitHub

	* Copy current folder repository into a clean folder for testing and merging for safety purposes. We can also start right away in the current folder repo, but better safe than sorry.
	* Enter directory and continue with line commands:
	     git checkout -b Rangi42-9bit 9bit
	* git pull git@github.com:Rangi42/polishedcrystal.git 9bit

	  Cloned Rangi's 9bit branch, and then the following appears:
	hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
	hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
	hint: your next pull:
	hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
	hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
	hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
	hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
	hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
	hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
	hint: invocation.
	fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

	* git config pull.rebase false
	* Another "git pull" as above will tell which file is the one with conflicts. Fix that one manually in a Text editor.
	* Once fixed, go "git add ." to add the new file properly and prepare it for merging.

	* git checkout 9bit
	* git merge --no-ff Rangi42-9bit (This one should fail)
	* git commit -m "Fix conflicts"
	* git push
