# To Do

> Of course, it is very difficult to make the game, so I hope people don't get their expectations up too high.

## Missing content

The final, non-beta 3.0 release should include all of these.


### General

* Search for "TODO" in the code and finish it
* Fix bugs, including everything on the [Issues](/issues)
* Trim egg moves to just leave the possible ones
* Adjust the difficulty curve as needed


### Maps

Maps need signs, NPCs, trainers (with [dialog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IDuWAP-QBRC5l4grKZKKlfWKQ2BjC2Yo0aynmli1Ac/view) (see also [material/pia-dialogue.txt](material/pia-dialogue.txt) and [material/pokeathlon-dialog.txt](material/pokeathlon-dialog.txt))), visible and hidden items, wild Pokémon, and unique wild moves.
