# To Do

> Of course, it is very difficult to make the game, so I hope people don't get their expectations up too high.

## Missing content

The final, non-beta 3.0 release should include all of these.


### General

* Search for "TODO" in the code and finish it
* Fix bugs, including everything on the [Issues](/issues)
* Give NPCs better teams, using the new held items
* Trim egg moves to just leave the possible ones
* Adjust the difficulty curve as needed


### Mechanics

* Add hidden grottoes throughout Johto
* Variety Channel with daily unique music
* Separate radio channels for March and Lullaby, available every day
* Send gift Pokémon to the PC if the party is full
* Generate Battle Tower Pokémon
* Generate random team for Psychic Inver
* Wild Ghosts and the SilphScope2
* More location-unique wild moves (see [material/moves.txt](material/moves.txt))
* Finish wild rosters
* DVs to vary palettes for trainers' duplicate Pokémon (e.g. Clair's Dragonairs)
* Encounter both kinds of regional Arboks in Route 28 + Mt. Silver
* Complete Alolan and Galarian forms
   * Persian as a one-time trade from an Alolan tourist (you can breed it for more)
   * Rattata/Raticate in Kanto
   * Grimer/Muk in Goldenrod City (Celadon's Muk are a sign of its pollution, Goldenrod's Alolan Muk would be a sign that they manage pollution better)
   * Sandshrew/Sandslash and Vulpix/Ninetales in the Ice Path and/or Seafoam Islands
   * Diglett/Dugtrio on Cinnabar Island (right now I replaced all Diglett with the Alolan ones, with the explanation that the volcano affected climate everywhere, but I'd rather have the ones in Diglett's Cave be normal)
   * Geodude/Graveler/Golem in Rock Tunnel (the Lodestone there is already used to evolve Magnezone)
   * Marowak, Exeggutor, and Raichu evolve while holding the Odd Souvenir (bought on Shamouti Island)
   * Ponyta/Rapidash on Shamouti Island
   * Corsola/Cursola in Scary Cave
   * Farfetch'd/Sirfetch'd instead of non-faithful Farfetch'd


### Aesthetics

* Play a shiny flash when Pokémon are caught (from Prism)
* "make hgss" to use HGSS-based palettes


### Events

* Soul House + Radio Tower event to get Expn Card (see [tentative dialog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IDuWAP-QBRC5l4grKZKKlfWKQ2BjC2Yo0aynmli1Ac/view))
* Saffron Trainer Fan Club, where meeting certain conditions turns NPCs into you fan, whereupon they give you items (see [material/trainer-fan-club.txt](material/trainer-fan-club.txt))
* Rematch Eusine in Celadon City if you have Suicune in your party
* Rematch Bill in his house somehow
* Calling Lyra should have more varied messages (see [material/lyra-dialog.txt](material/lyra-dialog.txt))
* Name trainers after anime characters (Jackson, Ritchie, Liza, Kidd, Lisa)
* Acquire dolls from NPCs throughout the regions
* Red goes back home after you battle him, and returns to Mt. Silver after you battle Green
* Clarify that Silver dropped his trainer card, like in HGSS
* Oak tells you to meet him in his lab after the Lance rematch to unlock Mt. Silver
* Replace Skyla with Marlon (team: Politoed, Tentacruel, Blastoise, Starmie, Mantine, Cloyster, Vaporeon)
* Nurse trainer class (heals you afterwards)
* Gambler trainer class (uses Game Corner mons)
* Soldier trainer class (in Lt. Surge's Gym; also ones elsewhere with Remoraid, Octillery, Forretress, Skarmory, Electrode, Donphan)

Shamouti Island:

* Caitlin and Darach in Beautiful Beach villa (EVENT_BEAT_DARACH and EVENT_BEAT_CAITLIN)
* Looker in hotel room (not S.S. Aqua)


### Maps

Maps need signs, NPCs, trainers (with [dialog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IDuWAP-QBRC5l4grKZKKlfWKQ2BjC2Yo0aynmli1Ac/view) (see also [material/pia-dialogue.txt](material/pia-dialogue.txt) and [material/pokeathlon-dialog.txt](material/pokeathlon-dialog.txt))), visible and hidden items, wild Pokémon, and unique wild moves.

* Connect the Magnet Train track south to Cherrygrove Bay
* Magnet Tunnel (TM74 Gyro Ball)
* Soul House
* Lavender Radio Tower (use Reina, DJ Fern, DJ Lily, and a Clefable+Gengar Couple)
* Saffron City Trainer Fan Club
* Valencia Island (signs and NPCs)
* Route 49 (wild Pokémon and unique wild moves)
* Safari Zone rest houses (NPCs and maybe trainers)
* Reference the Pokéathlon Dome inside the Route 35 gate or Route 35 Coast
* Goldenrod Museum


Shamouti Island:

* Shamouti Island
* Shamouti Hotel (haunted room) (EVENT_SAW_HAUNTED_ROOM)
* Shamouti Restaurant (works like Seven Stars Restaurant) (different subset of all trainers every day of the week)


### Optimizations

* Optimize map scripts with the various new commands and PERSONTYPE_GENERICTRAINER
* Phone uses a bitfield to allow storing all numbers
